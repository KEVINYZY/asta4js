        <p>For most MVVM frameworks, it is difficult to implement an infinite nested tree rendering/binding.</p>
        
        <p>
        For AngularJS, it becomes simple by making use of a third-party plug-in called
        <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui-tree/angular-ui-tree">angular-ui-tree</a>.
        As comparison, For Asta4js, it can be simply implemented by the default binding mechanism without any
        extra plug-in.
        </p>
        
        <p>There is a pair of pages to compare what is different between AngluarJS and Asta4js for tree rendering</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="asta4js.html">Tree rendering by Asta4js</a></li>
            <li><a href="angularUITree.html">Tree rendering by Angular-UI-Tree</a></li>

            <ul>
                <li>Pros
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very clean pure HTML template with high maintainability
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cons
                    <ul>
                        <li>The javascript side's source is a little bit complicated than Angular's way.
                        <li>Without common tasks(expand/collapse, drag/drop) support, but obviously, all of those can be done simply.

                <li>Pros
                    <ul>
                        <li>The logic in javascript is clean and simple
                        <li>With plenty built-in common tasks support, such as expand/collapse, drag/drop, etc.
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cons
                    <ul>
                        <li>The HTML template is chaos, even with HTML code in script tag.
