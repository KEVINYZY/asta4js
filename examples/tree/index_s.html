        <p>For most MVVM frameworks, it is difficult to implement an infinite nested tree rendering/binding.</p>
        
        <p>
        For AngularJS, it becomes simple by making use of a third-party plug-in called
        <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui-tree/angular-ui-tree">angular-ui-tree</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As comparison, For Asta4js, it can be simply implemented by the default binding mechanism without any
        extra plug-in.
        </p>
        
        <p>There is a pair of pages to compare what is different between AngluarJS and Asta4js for tree rendering</p>
